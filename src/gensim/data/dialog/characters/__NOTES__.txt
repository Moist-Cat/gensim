# What

Here are the main characters' dialog. If there is something to port from
eratohoTW it will be in an ascii text file with a bunch of lines of dialog
splattered all over the place. These are extracted from the source files
with the same name.

Currently porting:
Hong   moist (me)
    - first file has been divided in events


# How (Porting dialog)
1. Grab a source file (.ERB)
2. Get some dialog
3. Divide it in chunks and mark each possible event (or type) with a "#"
4. Put in in a text file (name it according the snek_case rules)
5. Create an event (with requirements, effects, etc)
